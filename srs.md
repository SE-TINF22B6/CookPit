## Software Requirements Specification
> This template is a simplified version based on the documentation templates from IBM Rational Unified Process (RUP).
### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Overview
In this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, we describe the details of the functional and non-functional prerequisites for the development of a captivating and highly interactive recipes website. The platform is designed with a multifaceted purpose, aiming to empower users to explore, discover, and archive a diverse array of culinary delights.

The primary audience comprises home cooks hailing from a wide spectrum of skill levels. With this diversity in mind, our objective is to construct an intuitive and user-friendly digital environment. This means ensuring that not only is the website easy to navigate, but it's also a delightful and informative hub for anyone with a passion for cooking. 

#### 1.2 Scope
> What is covered (not covered) in this document? Is it for your whole system or a subsystem? Does it cover both functional and nonfunctional requirements? (Will you seperate some of requirements into another document?)

This SRS document provides an exhaustive exploration of both the functional and non-functional requisites essential for the successful realization of the entire system. The scope of this document cover the whole project, but also it extends its purview to encompass specifications for various constituent modules that collectively constitute this software. 

Some of the functional requirements that will be listed in this SRS are the possibility of having a search bar to find a specific recipe, giving any user the chance of uploading a recipe at any moment, following other accounts, leaving comments in a recipe, the ability to save favorite recipes, the ability to view recipes in a detailed format, and setting tags to a recipe. The most important non functional requirements that will be discussed in this specification are maintainability, usability, reliability and documentation. The characteristics of each requirement will be detailed in their respective sections.

All the requirements of this projects are listed in the current document. Other resources may need to be consulted for more visual hints. For example, the diagrams of the use cases or the mockup of the graphical interface. The link to these materials will be shared below.

In addition to the description of the functional and non-functional dimensions, this SRS delves into the inherent technical constraints and opportunities inherent in the project. Furthermore, this SRS, explores the possibilities and limitations of the technologies that will be employed. Each technology is meticulously dissected, with explicit attention to the prerequisites.

To enhance clarity, this document incorporates a dedicated section explaining the technical concepts related to this undertaking.

By the nature of this project, the budget limitations will not be covered. This is because this is an academic project, therefore, there are not monetary resources assigned for its development. Realated to the previous point, this document does not cover neither the topic of generating economic profit after the deployment of this software. In addition, no legal concerns will be covered in this document.
#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations
> Definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret this document.
#### 1.4 References
> A complete list of all documents referenced. Each document should be identified by title, date, and publishing organization. You can also insert hyperlinks, in order to open the references conviniently.

### 2. Functional requirements
>  This section contains all the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.  
>  This section is typically organized by feature, but alternative organization methods may also be appropriate, for example, organization by user or organization by subsystem.

> [!NOTE]
> You can insert links to your UML diagrams and user stories, or labels of user stories into this document.

#### 2.1 Overview 
> A brief description of the functionality of your application.  
> Include one or more **UML use case** diagram(s) and necessary description to specify the major use cases of your application.

#### 2.2 Name of Feature 1 / Use Case 1
> Specify this feature / use case by:
> - Relevant **user stories (their links or labels)**
> - **UI mockups**
> - **UML behavior diagrams** and necessary text specification
> - **Preconditions**. *A precondition of a use case is the state of the system that must be present prior to a use case being performed.*
> - Postconditions. *A postcondition of a use case is a list of possible states the system can be in immediately after a use case has finished.*
> - **Estimated efforts (high, medium, low)**


#### 2.3 Name of Feature 2 / Use Case 2
... ...

### 3. Nonfunctional requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is not necessary to cover all of the following categories, but focus on what your project will implement.  
> If some nonfunctional requirements are described as user stories in your backlog, add their **links** in this section, or any information to guide the reader find them in your backlog, such as a **label** of those relevant user stories.

> Categories: Usability, Reliability, Performance, Efficiency, Integrity, Maintainability, Flexibility, Testability, Reusability, Security.  


### 4. Technical constraints
> Specify any major constraints, assumptions or dependencies, e.g., any restrictions about which type of server to use, which type of open source license must be complied, etc.
