## Software Requirements Specification
### 1. Introduction
The current document serves as a comprehensive blueprint for our project, outlining the detailed functional and non-functional requirements, system behavior, and constraints to guide the development team towards building a successful solution.

#### 1.1 Overview
In this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, we describe the details of the functional and non-functional prerequisites for the development of a captivating and highly interactive recipes website. The platform is designed with a multifaceted purpose, aiming to empower users to explore, discover, and archive a diverse array of culinary delights.

The primary audience comprises home cooks hailing from a wide spectrum of skill levels. With this diversity in mind, our objective is to construct an intuitive and user-friendly digital environment. This means ensuring that not only is the website easy to navigate, but it's also a delightful and informative hub for anyone with a passion for cooking. 

#### 1.2 Scope

This SRS document provides an exhaustive exploration of both the functional and non-functional requisites essential for the successful realization of the entire system. The scope of this document cover the whole project, but also it extends its purview to encompass specifications for various constituent modules that collectively constitute this software. 

Some of the functional requirements that will be listed in this SRS are the possibility of having a search bar to find a specific recipe, giving any user the chance of uploading a recipe at any moment, following other accounts, leaving comments in a recipe, the ability to save favorite recipes, the ability to view recipes in a detailed format, and setting tags to a recipe. The most important non functional requirements that will be discussed in this specification are maintainability, usability, reliability and documentation. The characteristics of each requirement will be detailed in their respective sections.

All the requirements of this projects are listed in the current document. Other resources may need to be consulted for more visual hints. For example, the diagrams of the use cases or the mockup of the graphical interface. The link to these materials will be shared below.

In addition to the description of the functional and non-functional dimensions, this SRS delves into the inherent technical constraints and opportunities inherent in the project. Furthermore, this SRS, explores the possibilities and limitations of the technologies that will be employed. Each technology is meticulously dissected, with explicit attention to the prerequisites.

To enhance clarity, this document incorporates a dedicated section explaining the technical concepts related to this undertaking.

By the nature of this project, the budget limitations will not be covered. This is because this is an academic project, therefore, there are not monetary resources assigned for its development. Realated to the previous point, this document does not cover neither the topic of generating economic profit after the deployment of this software. In addition, no legal concerns will be covered in this document.

### 2. Functional requirements
In this section, we delve into the specific functions the software application must perform, detailing the inputs required, processing logic, and the expected outputs under various conditions. These requirements are derived from extensive discussions with stakeholders, including end-users, product managers, and developers, ensuring that the software solution aligns seamlessly with the business objectives and user expectations.

The links to your UML diagrams will be added to this document.

#### 2.1 Overview 
This software is a digital platform designed to provide users with a wide range of culinary resources and tools to enhance their cooking experience. It offers the following functionalities:

1. **Recipes Database:** A vast collection of recipes spanning various cuisines, dietary preferences, and difficulty levels. Users can search for specific dishes or ingredients.

2. **Step-by-Step Guides:** Detailed instructions accompanied by images that guide users through the cooking process, ensuring they understand each step.

3. **User-generated Content:** Features that allow users to submit their recipes, photos, and cooking tips, fostering a sense of community and shared knowledge.

4. **Interactive Features:** Forums, comments sections, or social media integration to facilitate discussions, recipe sharing, and feedback among users.

5. **Personalized Recommendations:** Support from the OpenAI API that allows the users to prepare a meal with the ingredients they desire, instead of being restricted to get the ingredients for a given recipe.

In summary, this cooking website serves as a comprehensive culinary hub, offering recipes, instructional content, community interaction, and helpful tools to empower users in their cooking endeavors.  
> Include one or more **UML use case** diagram(s) and necessary description to specify the major use cases of your application.

#### 2.2 Name of Feature 1 / Use Case 1
> Specify this feature / use case by:
> - Relevant **user stories (their links or labels)**
> - **UI mockups**
> - **UML behavior diagrams** and necessary text specification
> - **Preconditions**. *A precondition of a use case is the state of the system that must be present prior to a use case being performed.*
> - Postconditions. *A postcondition of a use case is a list of possible states the system can be in immediately after a use case has finished.*
> - **Estimated efforts (high, medium, low)**


#### 2.3 Name of Feature 2 / Use Case 2
