# Unit Tests

Unit tests are a fundamental aspect of software development, serving as a crucial component of the testing process. They are designed to evaluate the smallest units of a software application, typically individual functions or methods, in isolation from the rest of the codebase. The primary goal of unit testing is to verify that each unit of code, often a function or class method, functions correctly as intended.

## Key Purposes of Unit Tests

1. **Isolation**: Unit tests are written to isolate specific parts of the code, ensuring that each unit's behavior is tested independently. This isolation helps identify and fix issues in isolation, making it easier to pinpoint the source of errors.

2. **Verification**: Unit tests verify that the code under test produces the expected output for various inputs and scenarios. This ensures that the code functions correctly according to its design.

3. **Regression Prevention**: Unit tests serve as a safety net to prevent the introduction of regressions, which are unintended side effects or bugs that can occur when code is modified or extended.

4. **Documentation**: Unit tests can serve as documentation for how a specific unit of code is expected to behave. Developers can refer to unit tests to understand the intended functionality.

5. **Continuous Integration**: Unit tests are often integrated into a continuous integration (CI) process. Automated testing in the CI pipeline ensures that new code changes do not break existing functionality.
