## Software Architecture Documentation
### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Overview
- Modularity and Separation of Concerns: We can separate different aspects of our application, such as presentation, business logic, and data access, into distinct layers. This makes our codebase more modular, easier to understand, maintain, and scale.
- Scalability: By separating concerns, we can scale different layers independently. For example, if our application experiences increased traffic, we can scale the presentation layer separately from the data access layer.
- Reusability: Each layer can be reused independently. For instance, our presentation layer can be reused across different interfaces (web, mobile), which promotes code reusability and reduces duplication. Its easier to deploy our application to different screensizes.
- Flexibility and Maintainability: With a clear separation of concerns, making changes to one layer does not necessarily affect the others. This makes it easier for us to modify, update, or replace individual components without impacting the entire system.
#### 1.2 Constraints
- Performance Overhead: Implementing multiple layers can introduce some performance overhead due to the communication between layers.
- Complexity: With multiple layers, the overall complexity of the system increases. This can make understanding and debugging more challenging.
- Data Transfer: Passing data between layers can become complex, especially when dealing with large volumes of data or complex data structures.
- Team Communication: Effective communication among team members is crucial to ensure that each layer integrates smoothly and that changes in one layer do not adversely affect others.
- Testing Strategies: Conventions for testing include writing unit tests for each layer individually, as well as integration tests to ensure that layers work together correctly.
