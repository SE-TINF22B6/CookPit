# CookPit
## Software Architecture Documentation
### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Overview
**selling points of our architecture design**
- Modularity and Separation of Concerns: We can separate different aspects of our application, such as presentation, business logic, and data access, into distinct layers. This makes our codebase more modular, easier to understand, maintain, and scale.
- Scalability: By separating concerns, we can scale different layers independently. For example, if our application experiences increased traffic, we can scale the presentation layer separately from the data access layer.
- Reusability: Each layer can be reused independently. For instance, our presentation layer can be reused across different interfaces (web, mobile), which promotes code reusability and reduces duplication. Its easier to deploy our application to different screensizes.
- Flexibility and Maintainability: With a clear separation of concerns, making changes to one layer does not necessarily affect the others. This makes it easier for us to modify, update, or replace individual components without impacting the entire system.
#### 1.2 Constraints
- Performance Overhead: Implementing multiple layers can introduce some performance overhead due to the communication between layers.
- Complexity: With multiple layers, the overall complexity of the system increases. This can make understanding and debugging more challenging.
- Data Transfer: Passing data between layers can become complex, especially when dealing with large volumes of data or complex data structures.
- Team Communication: Effective communication among team members is crucial to ensure that each layer integrates smoothly and that changes in one layer do not adversely affect others.
- Testing Strategies: Conventions for testing include writing unit tests for each layer individually, as well as integration tests to ensure that layers work together correctly.

### 2. Architecture Tactics
#### Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) from Semester 3:
1. **Performance** Ensure that the application can handle a high volume of concurrent users without significant degradation in response time.
2. **Security** Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Scalability** Design the system to easily scale up.
4. **Maintainability**  Structure the codebase in a way that facilitates ease of maintenance, updates, and bug fixes. 
5. **CUstomer needs** Ensure compatibility with various customer need to reach a wider audience.
6. **Usability** Design a user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience and encourages engagement.

#### Revised Architecture Tactics:
1. **Performance Optimization**
2. **dAuthentication**
3. **Load Balancing**
4. **Code Modularity**
5. **API Design**
6. **User Feedback**

### 3. Architecture Design
#### 3.1 Overview 
The architecture of CookPit is designed to address the aforementioned requirements and constraints while providing a scalable, maintainable, and secure platform for users to interact with. At its core, CookPit follows a layered architecture pattern, by using react. This promotes modularity, reusability, and flexibility within the system.

#### 3.2 Runtime View
(TODO)

**Description:**
The sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between various components during a typical user interaction with CookPit. It depicts the flow of control and data as a user performs actions such as browsing recipes, adding items to their shopping cart, and checking out.

#### 3.3 Deployment View
(TODO)

**Description:**
The deployment diagram depicts the physical deployment of CookPit components across different servers and environments. It illustrates how the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer are distributed and interconnected to form the complete system. Additionally, it highlights the use of load balancers, databases, and external services to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance.

#### 3.4 Component Diagram
(TODO)
**Description:**
The component diagram provides a high-level overview of the structural organization of CookPit components. It delineates the various modules and subsystems that constitute the application, along with their interconnections and dependencies. Key components such as user interface modules, business logic components, and data access layers are identified, showcasing the layered architecture of the system.
